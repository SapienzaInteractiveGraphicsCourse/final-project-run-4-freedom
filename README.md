## Getting Started
To start playing you don't need to clone this repo, since the game is available online at the following [link]().

If you want to modify our code, clone this repo and as a workaround for the cross-origin policy issue, start a web server on the local machine (e.g. via python3 -m http.server). Finally, enter the following URL in your browser http://localhost:8000/index.html.

## Built With
[three.js](https://threejs.org/) (a JavaScript 3D library with the aim to create an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library with a default WebGL renderer)

## Prerequisites
Any modern browser can run three.js since it makes use of WebGL to render scenes. Supported browsers includes:

- Google Chrome 9+
- Firefox 4+
- Opera 15+
- Safari 5.1+
- Internet Explorer 11
- Microsoft Edge

You can find which browsers support WebGL at [Can I use WebGL](https://caniuse.com/webgl).
