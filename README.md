# Getting Started
To start playing you don't need to clone this repo, since the game is available online at the following [link]().

# Built With
[three.js](https://threejs.org/) (a JavaScript 3D library with the aim to create an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library with a default WebGL renderer)

- Google Chrome 9+
- Firefox 4+
- Opera 15+
- Safari 5.1+
- Internet Explorer 11
- Microsoft Edge

You can find which browsers support WebGL at [Can I use WebGL](https://caniuse.com/webgl).
